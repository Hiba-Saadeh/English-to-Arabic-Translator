# English-to-Arabic-Translator

This repository contains an implementation of an English-to-Arabic translator using a Transformer-based neural network. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and inference for translating English sentences to Arabic.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing step involves:

Reading and cleaning the English-Arabic sentence pairs from a text file (ara_eng.txt).
Tokenizing and vectorizing the sentences.
Creating vocabulary dictionaries for both languages.
Padding the sequences to ensure uniform input size for the model.

## Model Architecture
The translation model is built using a Transformer-based architecture. Key components include:

An embedding layer for both English and Arabic sentences.
LSTM layers for sequence processing.
Dense layers for generating the final translated output.

## Training
To train the model, the notebook includes code to:

Define the model architecture.
Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Train the model on the preprocessed data with a defined number of epochs.

## Inference
For inference, the model takes an English sentence as input and generates the corresponding Arabic translation. The notebook provides functions to:

Tokenize and vectorize the input sentence.
Use the trained model to predict the translation.
Decode the predicted sequence back to Arabic text.

## Results
Sample translations generated by the model are included in the notebook. You can test the model with your own sentences to evaluate its performance.
